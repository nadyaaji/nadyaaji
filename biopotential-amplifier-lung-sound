# Biopotential Amplifier for Lung Sound Signal

This project is a **biopotential amplifier circuit** designed to acquire and analyze lung sound signals.  
It combines **analog circuit design, PCB prototyping, Arduino firmware (C), and Python-based signal processing** to build a working prototype for biomedical signal acquisition.  

Key results:
- Gain â‰ˆ 12  
- Bandwidth: 80â€“2000 Hz  
- CMRR: 70 dB  

ðŸ“‚ Includes PCB design files, circuit schematics, firmware code, and Python scripts for signal analysis.
